```sh
# start a  watching web-version
npm start

# build & run native
npm run native

# just build target, don't run
npm run web:build
npm run native:build
```

Paths are currently hard-coded, but you cna make it work by setting up `roms/` and `cores/`

```
📁 cores
├── fceumm_libretro.dylib
├── gambatte_libretro.dylib
└── snes9x_libretro.dylib
📁 roms
├── 📁 gb
├── 📁 nes
└── 📁 snes
```

You will need [cores](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/) in `cores/`:

- `fceumm`
- `gambatte`
- `snes9x`

For posters, you can run `python fetch_posters.py` and it will save them in `roms/`
